<h1 align="center">💼 Data Analyst | SQL | Excel | Power BI | Python</h1>

## 📌 About  
Hi, I’m **Hariharan Thirumurugan**, transitioning into Data Analytics after working in operational and client-facing roles across Airlines and coworking environments. These roles strengthened my problem-solving abilities, analytical mindset, and comfort with structured workflows. Over time, I became more aligned with understanding patterns, analysing performance, and improving processes rather than executing routine tasks.

I now work with **Excel, SQL, Python, Power BI, Tableau, and Statistics**, and have completed the **Skillovilla Data Analyst Program** and the **Google Data Analytics Certificate**. My work involves cleaning data, analysing trends, and creating dashboards that simplify decision-making.

Some of my recent projects include an **Airline Database Analysis using SQL**, exploring operational metrics, and a **Freshco Hypermarket Sales Analysis using Excel** focused on sales trends and performance insights. These projects strengthened my ability to interpret data and convert observations into meaningful conclusions.

I am actively looking to contribute in Data Analyst roles while continuing to develop deeper skills in analytics and insights.
